Functions tested for Part 1:
1. Checker.set_position()
2. Checker.get_board_position()
3. Checker.is_mouse_over()
4. Checker.draw()

Valid inputs and expected return values:
1. Checker.set_position(x, y)
   - Input: x and y within the range of the 2x2 board
   - Expected output: Checker's position updated to the new coordinates

2. Checker.get_board_position(x, y)
   - Input: x and y within the pixel coordinates of the 2x2 board
   - Expected output: Board position (row and column) corresponding to the pixel coordinates

3. Checker.is_mouse_over(x, y)
   - Input: x and y within the pixel coordinates of the checker
   - Expected output: True

4. GameController.mousePressed():
   assert mouseX, mouseY is within the board and is over the checker

Invalid inputs and expected return values:
1. Checker.set_position(x, y)
   - Input: x and y outside the range of the 2x2 board
   - Expected output: Checker's position remains unchanged

2. Checker.get_board_position(x, y)
   - Input: x and y outside the pixel coordinates of the 2x2 board
   - Expected output: Board position (-1, -1) indicating invalid coordinates

3. Checker.is_mouse_over(x, y)
   - Input: x and y outside the pixel coordinates of the checker
   - Expected output: False

Confidence in verifying every possible eventuality:
- The current testing plan covers the primary functionality for Part 1. However, additional test cases might be required for handling multiple checkers, captures, and computer opponent logic.

Bugs revealed by testing and fixed:
- The crown image not moving with the checker when it becomes a king
- The king not being restricted to move only downwards
